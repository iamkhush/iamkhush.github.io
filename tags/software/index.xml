Puts domain experts and developers on a level playing field, which produces software that makes perfect sense to the business, not just the coders. This doesn’t mean merely tolerating the opposite group. It means becoming one cohesive, tight-knit team. • That “makes sense to the business” thing means investing in the business by making software that is as close as possible to what the business leaders and experts would create if they were the coders.</description></item></channel></rss>
