Detailed Project Description
============================

The workbench project takes the workbench metaphore seriously. It’s a
platform that allows you to do work; it provides a flat work surface
that supports your ability to combine tools (python modules) together.
In general a workbench never constrains you (oh no! you can’t use those
3 tools together!) on the flip side it doesn’t hold your hand either.
Using the workbench software is a bit like using a Lego set, you can put
the pieces together however you want AND adding your own pieces is super
easy!.

Loosely coupled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  No inheritance relationships
-  No knowledge of data structures
-  Just take some input and barf some output (no format requirements)

Flat
~~~~
-  Workers (that’s it… everything is a worker)
-  Server dynamically loads workers from a directory called ‘workers’

Robust
~~~~~~
-  Worker fails to load (that’s fine)
-  Worker crashes (no sweat, that request fails but system chugs on)

Transparency
~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  All worker output is reflected in the data store (currently Mongo)
-  Use RoboMongo (see below) to inspect exactly what workers are
   outputting.

Small Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  The system works by passing references from one worker to another so
   there is NO benefit to large granularity workers.
-  It’s super easy to have a worker that aggregates information from a
   set of workers, the opposite (breaking apart a large code chunk into
   smaller units) is almost never easy.
-  Pull just what you want, workers and views (which are just workers)
   can be selectve about exactly which fields get pulled from which
   workers.
