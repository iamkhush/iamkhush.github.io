#### Animations
Animations have always amazed me. Beautiful still images are brought to life, objects are set in motion, etc, all mainly depending how the animators imagined and implemented it, probably using a animation tool. 

While my wife was making illustrations ([portfolio](https://surbhichadda.myportfolio.com/)), I decided to try my hands on some animations using [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html). You can check it out [here](https://surbhichadda.myportfolio.com/merry-christmas)


#### Video Editing
While this was fun, I also wanted to work on my Video Editing skills. My mom cooks delicious food and during this COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to create a Cooking Youtube channel, [Neelu's Indian Food Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be4lrHx7w1c&t=1s). I tried to gain some experience and created this video using Adobe Premiere Pro

and the following with Adobe Premiere Rush

I am very interested in learning 3d modelling using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Maybe a next update will be for that.
