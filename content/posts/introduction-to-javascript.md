## Data Types

Javascript has 6 primitive data types
- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `null`
- `Symbol`


## Objects

`Objects` can store collection of data types, called `properties`.
Each property has a `key` and `value`
`key` is of `string` data types and `value` can be of `any data type`.

If a `value` is a functon, its called as a `method`

### Equality in Objects

`==` or `===` only tests if both operands are same objects. 

### Arrays

`Objects` that store values in order.


## Functions

Use `function` keyword to define a function. 
- You may provide a name, if not, its called `anonymous`
- **Primatives passed in the function are passed by value but Objects are passed by reference.**

Functions( Both named or anonymous) can be assigned to a variable.
