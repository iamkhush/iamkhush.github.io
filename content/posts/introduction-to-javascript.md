## Data Types

Javascript has 6 primitive data types
- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `null`
- `Symbol`


`Objects` can store collection of data types, called `properties`.
Each property has a `key` and `value`
`key` is of `string` data types and `value` can be of `any data type`.

If a `value` is a functon, its called as a `method`
