# Introduction
I always wanted to understand economics basis, after looking at 2008 market crash and watching subsequent movies related to that , which try to explain the whole thing, led me to think I need to understand more of Economics. 
I stumbled upon a MIT course - [Principles of Microeconomics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2018).

I will be going through lectures in subsequent posts.

## Lecture 1
### Introduction
Microeconomics is study of how individual and firms make decision in world of *scarcity*.
They do *contrained optimizations* by making *tradeoffs*.
But behind tradeoffs there is an *opportunity costs*.

### Supply and Demand Model

Adam Smith - Father of economics
Paul Samuelson - Father of modern economics

The Supply and Demand model was brought by Adam Smith. It brings up 2 important analysis - positive and normalitive.
Positive analysis is study of what things are.
Nomalitive analysis is what things should be.

Example of normalitive question - should we be allowed to sell kidneys on an online auction ?

Adam Smith also mentions in his book the concept of "an invisible hand", which is a capatalist market will have competition and hence innovate and provide goods that are best for consumer.
