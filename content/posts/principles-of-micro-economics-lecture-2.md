summary: 'We go through the Demand curve, which is derived from how consumers make choices, and the supply curve, which is how firms make production decisions.'

## Demand curve
It is dervied from how consumers make choices. Our model will depend on _utility maximization_. This will have 2 components
- Consumer preferences
- Budget constraint - will be discussed in next lecture

### Conumer preferences
We will make preference assumptions in the model 
- Completeness - means you have preference for everything.
- Transitivity - If you prefer A to B and C to A then you prefer C to B as well.
- Non Satiation - meaning more is always better than less.

#### Indifference graphs
These are basically preferences maps / graphs. Since its a 2D thing, so you can only compare choices between 2 different things.
For example - 
- Between Quality and Location of a college while deciding a course
- Between Pizza and Cookies when you have set of options to buy between these 2.

Look at different graph examples [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2018/lecture-notes/MIT14_01F18_handout2.pdf)

These graphs have the folowing properties
- Consumer always prefers higher indifference curves. 
   - It is evident from the model aassumption - Non Satiation
- Curves are downward sloping.
- Curves never cross  ( check graph in examples)
   - Crossing curves means breaking the transitivity rule.
- You cant have more than 1 graph / curve on the same combination.

#### Utility functions
