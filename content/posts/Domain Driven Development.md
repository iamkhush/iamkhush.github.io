Why DDD 
- Puts domain experts and developers on a level playing field, which produces software that makes perfect sense to the business, not just the coders. This doesn’t mean merely tolerating the opposite group. It means becoming one cohesive, tight-knit team.

• That “makes sense to the business” thing means investing in the business by making software that is as close as possible to what the business leaders and experts would create if they were the coders.

• You can actually teach the business more about itself. No domain expert, no C-level manager, no one, ever knows every single thing about the business. It’s a constant discovery process that becomes more insightful over time. With DDD, everybody learns because everybody contributes to discovery discussions.

• Centralizing knowledge is key, because with that the business is capable of ensuring that understanding the software is not locked in “tribal knowledge,” available only to a select few, who are usually only the developers.

• There are zero translations between the domain experts, the software developers, and the software. That doesn’t mean maybe some few translations. It means zero translations because your team develops a common, shared language that everyone on the team speaks.

• The design is the code, and the code is the design. The design is how it works. Knowing the best code design comes through quick experimental models using an agile discovery process.

• DDD provides sound software development techniques that address both strategic and tactical design. Strategic design helps us understand what are the most important software investments to make, what existing software assets to leverage in order to get there fastest and safest, and who must be involved. Tactical design helps us craft the single elegant model of a solution using time-tested, proven software building blocks.
