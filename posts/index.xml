publish and subscribe events store events indefinitely process and analyze events Event An event has 3 main properties
key value timestamp Each event is a part of a stream, which stores its sequence for hundreds of years
Streams and KTables Streams KTables Provides immutable Data Provides mutable data Supports only inserts for new data Supports insert, update and delete Source - https://www.</description></item><item><title>Es6 Javascript</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/es6-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 22:14:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/es6-javascript/</guid><description>Iterables and Looping For looping over iterables, ES6 provides us with for of loop For looping over an object, Use Object.keys or .values in for of loop. Also, can use a for in loop where it iterates of enumarable properties. It will however iterate on keys not value of objects. Symbols New primitive added in ES6 Always unique Useful for keys with same names but different values Not enumarable Classes Just a wrapper around prototype inheritence.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Javascript 2</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/introduction-to-javascript-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 21:46:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/introduction-to-javascript-2/</guid><description>Understanding Scope The scope of a variable controls where it can be accessed from in the program. It can be of
Global Scope Function scope Block scope ( if / for etc ) Variable defination Variables can be defined with var, const and let keywords.
var keyword is function scoped let and const keyword are block scoped. this keyword Different from how other languages use this.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Javascript</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/introduction-to-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 22:56:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/introduction-to-javascript/</guid><description>Data Types Javascript has 6 primitive data types
number string boolean undefined null Symbol Objects Objects can store a collection of data types, which are then called properties. Each property has a key and value key is of string data types value can be of any data type. If a value is a functon, its called as a method Equality in Objects == or === only tests if both operands are same objects.</description></item><item><title>Scala Data Types</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/scala-data-types/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 19:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/scala-data-types/</guid><description>Scala&amp;rsquo;s unified type system Any is the super type Defines methods like - equals, hashCode, toString AnyVal represents value types. Double Float Long Int Short Byte Char Unit - Only one instance can be there - () Boolean AnyRef represent refernce types like List Nothing is subclass for all value types. Null is subclass for all reference types.

For example 1+1
Values are names for results for expressions. Example val x = 1 + 1
These are immutable Variables are mutable names for expression results.</description></item><item><title>Building Unity Games</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/building-unity-games/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:51:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/building-unity-games/</guid><description>Learning to build unity games using different resources online like Oreilly.

Beautiful still images are brought to life, objects are set in motion, etc, all mainly depending how the animators imagined and implemented it, probably using a animation tool.
While my wife was making illustrations (portfolio), I decided to try my hands on some animations using Adobe After Effects. You can check it out here
Video Editing While this was fun, I also wanted to work on my Video Editing skills.</description></item><item><title>Postgres Indexes, PL/pgSQL and other learnings</title><link>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/postgres-indexes-and-other-learnings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 01:30:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ankushchadda.in/posts/postgres-indexes-and-other-learnings/</guid><description>Recently I had to do a bit of reading on building Indexes in Postgres. Intrestingly I found some striking features about indexing types in Postgres
Extensions Postgres has a collection of extensions/modules. These are basically set of functions. One such module is pg_trgm. Quoting from the documentation- &amp;ldquo;pg_trgm provides functions and operators for determining the similarity of ASCII alphanumeric text based on trigram matching, as well as index operator classes that support fast searching for similar strings&amp;rdquo; Documentation</description></item></channel></rss>
